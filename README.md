# Consumer Complaint Resolution Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Consumer Complaint Resolution Prediction** project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether consumers are likely to dispute the resolution of their complaints. The project involves analyzing customer complaint data to identify patterns and factors influencing disputes and utilizing machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate prediction models.

## Features
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed customer complaint data to handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified and selected significant features contributing to the prediction of disputes.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
- **Model Building**: Developed and compared various classification models to predict complaint disputes, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using appropriate metrics and selected the best-performing model. 

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khushivermaz/customer-complaint-resolution.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Customer-Complaints-Resolution
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset into your environment.
2. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Model Training**: Use the provided scripts to train and evaluate the models.
4. **Results**: Review the performance metrics and select the best model for deployment.

## Results
The project outcomes include various graphs and performance metrics comparing the efficency of different models. The selected model will be detailed in the final report.
